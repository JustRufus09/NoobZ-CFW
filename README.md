# PLS, FOLOW THIS GUIDE IF YOU WANT THE SIGPACHES TO WORK

0 Go to ismyswitchpatched.com and select the prefix of your Switch S/N and the 1st 6 digits(should be on the bottom of your switch)

1 If your switch isn't patched, put the stuff into your switch SD card (4 GB minimum!!!) and put the Hekate payload .bin file onto your desktop!

2 Put your Switch into RCM mode. (Just google how to, i'm using the tinfoil trick, but it's safer to buy a RCM dongle on Amazon or ebay)

3 Inject the hekate payload, select payloads and choose Lockpick_RCM.bin!

4 Dump the keys and reboot into hekate!

5 Back to Hekate, select Launch and NoobZ CFW!

6 There is no step 6!

# I'll update the pack every month. No update requests!
